## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid using `any` type - use `unknown` or specific types instead

### Native Code

#### Android (Java)

- Follow Android coding conventions
- Use AndroidX libraries
- Handle permissions properly
- Support Android API 23+ (Android 6.0+)

#### iOS (Swift)

- Follow Swift naming conventions
- Use Swift 5.1+
- Support iOS 13.0+
- Handle permissions and entitlements properly

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```

- Implement AES-GCM encryption using Web Crypto API
- Add session management utilities
- Update TypeScript definitions

Fixes #123
```
